## Moves the Mind
A Hex Casting addon focused on the manipulation of player-like entities, provided by the [Carpet mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/carpet). Created for the first Hex Casting addon jam, aptly titled HexJam. 

### History
This addon was born out of a fascination with a similar feature that previously existed on a Hex Casting public server. This earlier iteration of the player manipulation was created using another Hex Casting addon for 1.19, [HexJS](https://modrinth.com/mod/hexjs). When that server updated to 1.20 with the newer port of hex, the carpet fakeplayer manipulation didn't come with it. I particularly liked the style of the idea and decided to recreate it into a full-fledged java addon as part of HexJam.

### Features
Moving media Moves the Mind, and the mind must be moved for the body to follow. Each player can currently summon one fakeplayer, and control its movements using the suite of patterns added by this mod. Direct it to look, walk, jump, crouch, drop items, attack, and more! Future updates will add easier controlling paradigms, some more control flow patterns, and other amenities.
